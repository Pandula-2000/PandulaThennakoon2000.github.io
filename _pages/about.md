## 👋 About Me

I am **Pandula Thennakoon**, a researcher in **Electrical and Electronic Engineering** with a strong background in **signal processing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning**.  
My research focuses on developing intelligent computational models that bridge **theoretical signal representation** with **modern deep learning** techniques — particularly in the areas of **implicit neural representations (INRs)** and **agent-based modeling of complex systems**.

I am currently applying for **PhD programs** in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, aiming to advance the frontier of intelligent systems for **signal understanding, modeling, and synthesis** across both physical and social domains.

## 🧠 Selected Research

### **1. COSMO-RC: Complex Sinusoidal Modulation for Implicit Neural Representations**  
*(Under review at ICLR 2026)*  
This work introduces **COSMO-RC**, a novel activation framework for INRs that leverages **complex sinusoidal modulation** to overcome *spectral bias* — a major limitation in continuous signal models.  
By coupling **harmonic distortion analysis** with **Chebyshev polynomial theory**, the model ensures balanced high-frequency support, improving representation quality across multiple domains.

- Achieved **+5.67 dB PSNR** gain in image reconstruction over SOTA INR models  
- Demonstrated superior performance in **denoising**, **super-resolution**, and **3D reconstruction**  
- Provides new theoretical foundations linking **harmonic analysis** and **neural signal modeling**

📄 *Paper:* “COSMO: Complex Sinusoidal Modulation for Implicit Neural Representations” (Under Review, ICLR 2026)

### **2. AVSim: Realistic Simulation Framework for Airborne and Vector-Borne Disease Dynamics**  
*(Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems, 2025)*  
**AVSim** is an agent-based simulation platform that models the spread of infectious diseases such as **COVID-19** and **dengue** under **realistic human mobility patterns**.  
The framework integrates **GPS-derived mobility data**, **spectral clustering**, and **graph-theoretic behavior modeling** to achieve realistic human motion and environmental interaction modeling.

- Models **occupation-based mobility** and social heterogeneity  
- Validated with real-world GPS data from 13 profession classes  
- Simulates **vaccination**, **quarantine**, and **vector-control** strategies  
- Demonstrates how AI and signal modeling principles can enhance **epidemic forecasting**

## 🎯 Research Vision

My long-term goal is to advance **signal intelligence** — developing systems that can *understand, represent, and simulate* complex real-world phenomena.  
By combining mathematical signal theory, deep learning, and agent-based modeling, I aim to create models that are not only **highly expressive** but also **physically interpretable** and **scientifically grounded**.
