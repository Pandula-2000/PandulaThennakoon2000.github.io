**Summary:**  
**AVSim** is a realistic agent-based modeling framework for **airborne** and **vector-borne** diseases that integrates **real-world GPS mobility data**, **spectral clustering**, and **graph-theoretic behavior analysis**.  
It models **occupation-specific behavior** and **transportation networks** to simulate epidemic spread with fine spatial and behavioral granularity.

**Highlights:**
- Incorporates **occupation-based movement patterns** from real-world GPS traces  
- Simulates **quarantine, vaccination, and vector-control** policies  
- Models **COVID-19** and **dengue** dynamics using an extended SEIR structure  
- Combines **AI**, **signal modeling**, and **epidemiology** under one framework  

**Keywords:** Agent-Based Modeling, Epidemiology, Complex Systems, AI for Public Health

  <h2>AVSim: Realistic Simulation Framework for Airborne and Vector-Borne Disease Dynamics</h2>
  <p><em>Venue:</em> Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems (2025)</p>

  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>AVSim</strong> is an agent-based simulation platform that models both airborne (e.g., COVID-19) and
    vector-borne (e.g., dengue) disease spread under <strong>realistic human mobility</strong>. It integrates
    GPS-derived mobility data, <em>spectral clustering</em>, and <em>graph-theoretic behavior analysis</em> to
    capture occupation-specific routines and transportation effects.
  </p>

  <h3>Highlights</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Occupation-based mobility derived from real GPS traces across 13 professions.</li>
    <li>Policy simulation: vaccination, quarantine, and vector-control strategies.</li>
    <li>Extended SEIR with patch-based vector dynamics; fine spatial & behavioral fidelity.</li>
  </ul>
