**Summary:**  
**AVSim** is a realistic agent-based modeling framework for **airborne** and **vector-borne** diseases that integrates **real-world GPS mobility data**, **spectral clustering**, and **graph-theoretic behavior analysis**.  
It models **occupation-specific behavior** and **transportation networks** to simulate epidemic spread with fine spatial and behavioral granularity.

**Highlights:**
- Incorporates **occupation-based movement patterns** from real-world GPS traces  
- Simulates **quarantine, vaccination, and vector-control** policies  
- Models **COVID-19** and **dengue** dynamics using an extended SEIR structure  
- Combines **AI**, **signal modeling**, and **epidemiology** under one framework  

**Keywords:** Agent-Based Modeling, Epidemiology, Complex Systems, AI for Public Health
