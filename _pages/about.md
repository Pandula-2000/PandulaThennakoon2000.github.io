## About Me

I am **Pandula Thennakoon**, a researcher in **Electrical and Electronic Engineering** with a strong background in **signal processing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning**.  
My research focuses on developing intelligent computational models that bridge **theoretical signal representation** with **modern deep learning** techniques — particularly in the areas of **implicit neural representations (INRs)** and **agent-based modeling of complex systems**.

I am currently applying for **PhD programs** in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, aiming to advance the frontier of intelligent systems for **signal understanding, modeling, and synthesis** across both physical and social domains.
