Here are some of the research projects I’ve worked on, focusing on **signal processing**, **AI**, and **simulation modeling**.

## 🧠 COSMO-RC: Complex Sinusoidal Modulation for Implicit Neural Representations
*Under review at ICLR 2026*

This project explores a **new activation mechanism** for implicit neural representations (INRs) using **complex sinusoidal modulation** and **Chebyshev analysis**.  
It mitigates spectral bias and enhances frequency support across layers, achieving superior performance in image reconstruction, denoising, and 3D shape representation.

**Key highlights:**
- +5.67 dB improvement in image reconstruction over state-of-the-art INR models  
- Theoretical proof using harmonic distortion and polynomial expansion  
- Open-source implementation with PyTorch

## 🧬 AVSim: Realistic Agent-Based Simulation for Disease Dynamics  
*Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems (2025)*  

AVSim is an **agent-based modeling framework** that integrates **real-world GPS data**, **spectral clustering**, and **graph-theoretic behavioral modeling** to simulate disease spread under realistic human mobility.

**Features:**
- Combines *signal modeling* and *AI* to simulate airborne and vector-borne diseases  
- Incorporates real occupation-based movement patterns  
- Includes modules for vaccination, quarantine, and vector control policy analysis

## ⚙️ Future Work
I am currently extending these ideas toward **hybrid models** that combine *implicit neural representations* with *physics-informed priors* for high-dimensional signal and system modeling.
