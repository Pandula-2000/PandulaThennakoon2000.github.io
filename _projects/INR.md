**Summary:**  
This project introduces **COSMO-RC**, a new activation mechanism for implicit neural representations (INRs) based on **complex sinusoidal modulation**.  
It mitigates *spectral bias* and improves the frequency representation of signals across layers.

**Highlights:**
- Derived a new theoretical framework combining **harmonic distortion analysis** and **Chebyshev polynomial theory**  
- Achieved **+5.67 dB PSNR** improvement over SOTA methods in image reconstruction tasks  
- Demonstrated effectiveness in **denoising**, **super-resolution**, and **3D shape reconstruction**

**Keywords:** Implicit Neural Representation, Signal Processing, Activation Functions, Deep Learning
